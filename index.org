#+TITLE: Women of the World Communication

* Communication is Sharing

  How hard is it to confine our feelings, thoughts, emotions or
  beliefs to our own selves? How painful that can be to not be able
  communicate what we want or what we need.

  Not expressing who we are and what we think increases the distance
  separating us from other people in society. Not sharing our pain
  makes it hurt more than other people's pain. Not sharing our
  happiness makes other people's happiness seem less important than
  ours. Sharing who we are is how we build common things together,
  that's how we build our culture.

  Sadly, our society hasn't learned how to provide the fundamental
  right of communicating to everybody. That compromises our ability to
  collaborate and build a thriving society together. We need to
  communicate to succeed as a global community.

  Women of the World are challenging this reality. Instead of
  suppressing their pains, their feelings, and their thoughts, some
  women decided to get together and change our entire culture to help
  us freeing ourselves from this human limitation. The WoW event is
  the living proof that women know how to do that and that's why there
  are so many people working so hard to bring this event to more than
  50 countries.

  Such inspiration should also draw how the Media and Communication of
  the Apollo/NYC WoW is done. We should think of a system that allows
  women participating in the event to feel empowered to communicate
  with the World. Every women that experiences the WoW should leave
  the event knowing that she has the right to communicate who she is
  in her home, in her job, and in all other places she may have felt
  denied of doing so.

  The challenge of building a Media and Communication plan that can't
  be addressed by single individuals. We need to build a diverse
  collective of people willing to share their time and skills to
  document and promote the ideas defended by the event. This
  collective can be thought of an opportunity to try the changes we
  want to do to the world on a smaller group of people.

* Team Recruiting

  The communication of the event will be made by people that are
  actively participating on the event as attendees and volunteers at
  the same time. They will write about what what they experience
  there.

  This section describes which roles are needed for the set of goals
  proposed in the section "Practical Results Expected".

** Core Team (approximately 15 people)
   The collaborative communication effort needs a core team. The
   responsibilities of the core team are:

*** Initial volunteers
    The bootstrap of the core team starts with volunteers that are
    proposing the idea. They will be responsible for finding other
    people to fill in the Media and Tech roles on the core team.
*** Media (approximately 10 people)
    * Communicating about the event with the global community through
      our Blog, Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, Google Groups, Newspaper,
      etc.
    * Interface with research to publish articles backed with data to
      be consumed in during a longer period of time, specially after
      the event.
    * Coordinate with Tech to support volunteers with no experience
      from the Comm Room.
*** Tech (2 to 5 people)
    * Put the Website and Blog together
    * Interface with the Apollo tech people that take care of buying
      domains, hosting the systems
    * Support the Media team with general tech support. From
      malfunctioning keyboards to broken logins to fixing wordpress
      bugs, that will be fun.
    * Establish tools to help everyone coordinate the calendar of
      activities of the collective (core team and publishers).
*** Research
    * Coordinate "Research and Feedback Program"
*** Everyone
    * All core team members are responsible for watching how many
      volunteers we have working on the team and how many we may need
      through out all the process.
    * Support the publishers in all their needs, from technical
      guidance to content review to calendar management.
    * The amount of content and impact created will depend on the
      number of volunteers that can be captured and managed in the
      process. Guaranteeing an open, inclusive and comprehensive is a
      must to succeed.

** Publishers

   The publishers are going to write most of the content produced by
   the communication team. They will receive support from the core
   team to produce and publish their content.

   The only requirement to be a publisher is to be willing write about
   their experience of the event.

   There are different ways publishers can contribute. The volunteer
   will capture what they experience in words and will be guided by
   the core team to publish their content in the right places. More
   specific information 

* Practical Results Expected

** Documentation of the Event

   We're planning to start sharing content about the event as soon as
   the collective is formed. The easiest way to start is to publish
   content on the Internet, other medias like newspapers, articles,
   and other events, are also in the sight.

   The core team is responsible for coordinating with the publishers
   to make sure enough content is captured from the "Media Sources"
   and published into the "Media Sinks".

*** Media Sources (Where do we get our content from)
**** Note Taking
     Every activity could have a note taker. Someone that will listen
     and document their experience. Taking notes shouldn't prevent the
     person in charge of it to fully experience the activity. The
     notes are small but more accurate because they're taken while the
     information is super fresh.

**** Phone Captured
     * Tweets from everyone
     * Images posted through the schedule system?
     * Streamed interviews

**** Daily articles
     People writing articles about activities they watched. We need a
     group that can rotate through different activities and document
     what they see and how they feel about the event.

**** Research and Feedback Program
     Provide research and data analysis about achievements and
     challenges of women around the world, and monitoring the
     attendeeâ€™s opinion using surveys and analysing online buzz during
     the event.

     * Using data to illustrate the panels and tell a meaningful story
       about the achievements and challenges of women around the
       world;
     * Creating and analysing post event survey evaluation, and the
       online buzz about the WOW;

*** Media Sinks (Places to publish our content)
**** Event Brochure
     Printable form of a selection of the entire event with all the
     material collected from all the media sinks.
